This React Native code uses AsyncStorage to store user data. However, it fails to handle potential errors during the asynchronous storage operations, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  Specifically, the `setItem` and `getItem` methods do not include `.catch` blocks to handle potential exceptions like storage full errors or other I/O issues.  This makes the app less robust and prone to failure in less-than-ideal conditions.
